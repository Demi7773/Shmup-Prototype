# Shmup-Prototype
An early prototype of a top-down Shoot-em-up game I am working on as a solo project to experiment with systems and mechanics.

I am mainly uploading this as a portfolio project to showcase my work as a new developer.
This project is a work in progress and will be upgraded, cleaned up and iterated upon when I have more time to work on it.
It is source code for a top-down Shoot-em-up game. The gameplay loop consists of clearing waves of enemies on a level until cleared. 
The enemies drop cash which can be used to purchase new weapons at the shop. Each weapon has a unique and powerful special attack.
The prototype is in a very early stage and is almost completely cubed out, with no 3d models or animations.
It does feature some visual effects I worked on, as well as downloaded assets for music, shooting sound effects and weapon icons.

*IMPORTANT*: This repository only has the code for the game. Other relevant data and assets are not included due to upload limitations. 
If you are interested in seeing more of this project, or my work in general, feel free to contact me.
